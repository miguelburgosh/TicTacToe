## :motorway: Roadmap of future improvements

- Applying different style.
  By editing the CSS style file, particularly the properties of selectors button and game board such as background color, border width, color and radius.
- Including a winner alert.
  I will add inside checkForWinner function, an alert as part of a conditional that pops to inform the winner once is defined.
